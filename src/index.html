                <p class="cs-item-text">
                We got his name from Yelp and we lived out of state. He went to our condo, gave estimate, and did the work without ever meeting us in person. He went well above and beyond scraping our popcorn ceiling. And did extra things we didn’t even ask for. Overall, his heart and soul far outweigh the awesome work he does.

                    There was an upfront price showed up one time. Got the job done when he said it was gonna be done and I’m in love with my new house. Complete transformation thank you so much.

                  Chris painted our newly installed front doors and did a great job.  The doors and trim look great. Chris is very pleasant, professional, and easy to work with. We will use him again for future work.

                    Chris took on a very large job in our St. Pete home, including demo of walls and ceilings; popcorn removal; dry walling; some electrical, and entire paint job throughout the home. He is passionate in his work and ensured that our vision came to life.  Thank you!!!
